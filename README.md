graphslib
This library is supposed to provide an all-together solution to graph data structures and parsing them
It includes weighted and unweighted, directional and undirectional Graph classes, Node and Vertex classes.

Graph contains built in searching algorithm (DFS, BSF under construction),
WeightedGraph is subclassed from Graph and contains built in algorithms for MST (Kruskal) and Shortest Path (Dijkstra),
BinaryIndexedTree is independent class and has append, search, sort functions

Note: This is not the best solution. I made this as an all together graph solutions in half a day to use in the
IEEEXtreme13.0 competition the same night. Any comments, suggestions and improvements are kindly requested and accepted!
